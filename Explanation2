Generate Motifs: The function generate_motifs(n, edges) is the main function of this script. Given a set of edges and an integer n, it generates a directed graph using the networkx library and finds all subgraphs of the graph that contain n nodes. These subgraphs are then passed to the find_motif_instances function to identify the unique motifs and their instances within the graph. The results are then written to a text file.

Relabel Graph: The function relabel_graph(G) is defined but not used in the script.
It is designed to relabel the nodes of a graph in ascending order.
This could be useful for standardizing node labels across different graphs or subgraphs, which can make it easier to compare and analyze them.

Find Motif Instances: The function find_motif_instances(subgraphs, n) processes the list of subgraphs generated by generate_motifs.
It first checks if each subgraph is valid (i.e., it has the correct number of nodes and a sufficient number of edges).
Then, for each valid subgraph, it sorts the nodes and creates a sorted version of the subgraph.
It then compares this sorted subgraph to the motifs it has already found.
If the sorted subgraph matches a known motif, it is added to the list of instances of that motif.
If it does not match any known motifs, it is added as a new motif.

This script uses some advanced graph theory concepts and techniques, such as adjacency matrices, to perform its operations.
An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph.
The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph.
In this script, adjacency matrices are used to compare different subgraphs (potential motifs) for equality.

One key aspect of the approach used in this script is that it treats motifs as being equivalent if they have the same structure,
regardless of the labels of the nodes. This is why it sorts the nodes and compares sorted subgraphs: it's a way of normalizing the subgraphs so that they can
be compared based purely on their structure, not the specific labels of the nodes.

Overall, this script demonstrates an efficient way to identify and categorize motifs in a graph, which is a common task in network analysis.
